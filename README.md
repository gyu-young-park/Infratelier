# Infratelier
**Infratelier** is my personal atelier and lab for exploring and experimenting with various infrastructure-related technologies such as Linux, Virtual Machines, Kubernetes, AWS, and CNCF projects.

This repository serves as a centralized space to organize and document installation guides, usage instructions, and important notes for a wide range of infrastructure projects I work on.

## Purpose

- To consolidate knowledge and best practices around infrastructure technologies.
- To provide clear and concise installation and usage guides.
- To share insights, tips, and caveats encountered while working with different tools and platforms.

## What to Expect

- Step-by-step installation tutorials.
- Configuration and usage examples.
- Troubleshooting and common pitfalls.
- Regular updates with new infrastructure projects and tools.
